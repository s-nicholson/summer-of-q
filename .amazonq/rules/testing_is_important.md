When making changes to code we should also be running the tests to avoid introducing bugs and adding new tests when we add new functionality.

We don't particularly care about a figure for test coverage - the main thing we care about is that we have expressive tests which tell us about how our application code works, and that the core features of the application code are tested.

TDD is not essential, but should be used where appropriate.
