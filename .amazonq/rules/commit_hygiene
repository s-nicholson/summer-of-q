Git commits should be descriptive and should focus on the "why" of a change, rather than the "what" (the diff of the commit tells us what changed).

Ideally, a commit should follow the format:
```
Title

Body
```

Title should be short to allow better use of the oneline view of git history.

Body can include more information and potentially a bulleted list of info about the commit.
