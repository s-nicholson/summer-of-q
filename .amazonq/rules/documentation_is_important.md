When making changes to code we should try to keep the local documentation up-to-date.

- The README should reflect the current state of the project - e.g. examples of running command line tools should be correct.
- Every "project" (top-level directory in `summer-of-q`) should contain a README which explains the purpose of the project and how to run it.
