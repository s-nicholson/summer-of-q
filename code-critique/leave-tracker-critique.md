# Code Critique: Leave Tracker

## Overview

The leave-tracker project is a command-line tool for tracking annual leave allowance. It allows users to set up their leave parameters, add/remove leave entries, list entries, and view their current balance.

## Strengths

- **Well-structured code**: Clear separation between core functionality (`LeaveTracker`) and CLI interface (`LeaveTrackerCLI`).
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: Tests cover core functionality and edge cases.
- **Good documentation**: README provides clear usage instructions and examples.
- **User-friendly CLI**: Intuitive commands and helpful output formatting.
- **Data persistence**: Properly saves and loads configuration and leave data.
- **Error handling**: Appropriate error messages for missing files and invalid inputs.
- **Flexible date handling**: Correctly manages leave years (Sept-Aug) rather than calendar years.

## Areas for Improvement

### Code Structure and Design

- **Missing `.amazonq` symlink**: No symlink to parent rules directory as required by project standards.
- **Inconsistent naming**: Directory uses hyphen (`leave-tracker`) while code uses underscore (`leave_tracker`).
- **Limited modularity**: Could benefit from splitting into multiple modules as the project grows.
- **Hard-coded values**: Some values like periods per year (24) are hard-coded rather than configurable.

### Documentation

- **Incomplete README**: The "Getting Started" and "Usage" sections in the README are placeholders.
- **Missing docstrings**: Some methods lack detailed docstrings (e.g., `_print_box`).
- **No type hints in docstrings**: Method parameters and return values aren't documented with types.

### Testing

- **Incomplete CLI testing**: Not all CLI commands have comprehensive tests.
- **No integration tests**: Only unit tests are present; end-to-end tests would be valuable.
- **No test for legacy config format**: The code handles legacy config format but lacks tests for this case.

### Error Handling and Validation

- **Limited input validation**: No validation for date format in CLI (relies on exceptions).
- **No confirmation for destructive actions**: No confirmation prompt when removing entries.
- **Missing error handling**: Some edge cases aren't handled (e.g., invalid JSON in config file).

### Code Quality

- **Redundant code**: Some repeated logic could be extracted into helper methods.
- **Inconsistent error messages**: Some error messages are more helpful than others.
- **No logging**: Relies on print statements instead of proper logging.

### Security and Best Practices

- **No data backup**: No mechanism to backup or restore data.
- **No version control in data files**: No way to track or revert changes to leave data.
- **Limited configuration options**: No way to customize file paths or date formats.

## Recommendations

1. Create the required `.amazonq/rules` symlink to comply with project standards.
2. Standardize naming conventions (choose either hyphen or underscore consistently).
3. Add proper logging instead of print statements.
4. Implement confirmation for destructive actions.
5. Enhance input validation to provide better user feedback.
6. Complete the README with proper "Getting Started" and "Usage" sections.
7. Add integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality.
8. Extract configuration constants to make them customizable.
9. Implement data backup and restore functionality.
10. Add version control for data files to track changes.

## Conclusion

The leave-tracker project is well-structured and functional with good test coverage. With some improvements to documentation, error handling, and additional features, it could be even more robust and user-friendly.
